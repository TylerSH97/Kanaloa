# Black Buoys

The purpose of this document is to explain the operation, installation, and 
maintenance of black buoys to be used in the 2018 RobotX Competition Avoid Obstacles task. 
Refer to page 9 of the https://www.robotx.org/images/RobotX-2018-Tasks_v2.0.pdf for background information on this task. 
The WAM-V will avoid black buoy obstacles in preparation for this competition.

### Installation:
```
Components (per buoy)
•	Black SPRI 75 cm diameter weighted exercise ball
•	¼” x 100’ Utility Line Polypropylene Invincible Marine 
•	3 foot long 2 inch diameter PVC pipe
•	Black electrical tape (buy waterproof tape)
•	25 – 30 pound Kettle Bell
•	About 20 black zip ties
```
```
Steps:
1. Pump ball up to about 60 cm diameter. This should take about 5 minutes if pumped by hand.

2. First place Utility Line Polypropylene rope around entire equator of ball. Temporarily add duct tape to rope and ball to hold in place.

3. From the equator, turn rope at a +90 degree angle and circle entire ball again, passing the North Pole once, and stopping after reaching the North Pole again.

4. At the North Pole, rotate rope 90 degrees counter clock wise and circle entire ball once. Stop after passing about 2 inches after the North Pole. 

5. Use black zip ties to permanently connect rope together. Be sure the top of the zip tie is facing away from the ball. Clip the ENTIRE extra zip tie line to ensure the top of the zip tie is smooth.

6. Wrap black electrical tape around each zip tie to reduce the chance of the zip tie puncturing a hole in the ball.

7. Pump the ball to around 75 cm or right before the rope starts to deform the ball. 

8. At the North Pole of ball, tie off remaining rope using a Bowline knot. Refer to video below for instructions on this knot.

9. At South Pole of ball, use a SEPARATE rope to tie 23 feet of rope to the ball. Tie using a Slip Knot. The purpose of this knot is to be able to quickly adjust the length of available rope, hence the name, “Slip Knot”. Refer to video below for instructions on this knot.

10. Mark a line at 20’ and 21’ from the South Pole of the ball. The maximum depth of Sand Island, where the test will be conducted, is 20’ deep. 

11. Attach the 25 – 30 pound weight to the opposite end of this rope using a bowline knot.  

12. *ONLY if not using a kettle bell weight: Using a SEPARATE length of rope, tie another bowline knot to the weight to create a handle. Run the rope through a 2-inch PVC pipe to make it more comfortable to hold the weight. 

13. To store ball, deflate and reflate when needed. The rope remains fixed.

### Operation:
```
Steps:
1. Start by inflating the black ball until RIGHT before the rope deforms the ball.
 
2. Adjust the slipknot to create a length of rope that matches the depth of the water where the buoys will float. IMPORTANT: If the rope is longer than the depth, the buoy will drift by that extra length. If the rope is shorter than the depth, the buoy will be pulled underwater and someone will need to pull it up. 

Example: The depth of water is 15 feet. The length of rope is 18 feet. Therefore, the ball will drift by 3 meters in any given direction.

3. A person may either walk the weight into the ocean, or drop the weight from a boat.

 IMPORTANT: Do not hold the South Pole rope that connects the weight to the ball when you drop it into the ocean. Doing so may result in rope burn. Hold the rope from the North Pole.
```

### Maintenance:
```
Some electrical tape may peel off after being used in the water. Replace the tape on the rope if this happens.

Periodically inspect ball for holes, especially where the zip ties are located.
```
