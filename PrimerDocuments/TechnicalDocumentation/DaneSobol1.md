The purpose of this tutorial is to create a light buoy that may be read by scan the
code color recognition sensors from the WAM-V. One of the 2018 RobotX challenges
is for the WAM-V to record the location and color of a light source from a floating
buoy. These colors are red, green, and blue. Two separate projects will be
considered in the overall light buoy design: How to create a light pole, and how to
create a floating platform to support this light pole.
